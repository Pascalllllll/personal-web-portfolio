> **A modern, interactive, and 3D-enhanced personal portfolio website built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js.**

![Preview Screenshot](preview.png)

## ✨ Overview

This is my **personal portfolio website**, built to showcase my profile, skills, and projects through an elegant and immersive interface.  
The site features a **3D animated background**, **sparkle effects**, and **smooth theme transitions**, combining aesthetics with technical depth.

Developed with **React**, powered by **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering, and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for clean, responsive design.

## 🧠 Features

### 🪩 3D Particle Background  
A real-time, shader-based fluid animation built with **Three.js GLSL shaders**.  
Colors dynamically adapt to the active theme (light/dark), and the movement subtly reacts to mouse position.

### ✨ Sparkle Click Effect  
Each mouse click triggers a burst of glowing particles radiating in random directions — a modern, delightful touch that adds energy to the interface.

### 🌙 Theme Switching  
Supports light and dark modes with a **smooth circular reveal animation**.  
All theme colors are defined using **HSL variables** for easier fine-tuning and global palette control.

### 💫 Smooth Scrolling & Glow Effects  
Sections and typography are styled with soft shadows and gentle transitions, creating a polished and cohesive experience.
